# Hospital-Navigation-System
Web Platform for navigation through hospital admission information 

The user is a caregiver or a relative of a patient. By selecting a patient health condition and the demographics,
the user will be presented with useful information on the hospital characteristics of admissions of other patients
who share similar conditions and have same demographics with the patient of interest. Useful statistics may include, 
but are not limited to the Length of Stay, in-hospital mortality and others. Most of your queries make aggregations 
on your data to filter and summarize them accordingly. The user can also compare how these expected indicators vary 
across different healthcare providers. You will be provided with a csv file which includes data on all the required 
attributes that you need to implement the project. Based on this dataset you may need to identify more potentially 
useful attributes that can be used to provide further feedback to the user. You will be expected to make a functional 
web application and showcase some real scenarios
